          <p>Tavara was born from a personal experience—when our founders' mother needed care, the family saw firsthand how difficult and fragmented the caregiving system was. Finding reliable caregivers, managing schedules, and ensuring quality care was overwhelming.</p>
          
          <p>This revealed a bigger issue: caregiving doesn't just need more workers—it needs better systems, stronger communities, and real support for both families and caregivers. So, we built Tavara.</p>
