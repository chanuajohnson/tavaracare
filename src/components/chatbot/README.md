2.2 Data Flow
User interactions flow through the UI components
Actions are processed by specialized hooks (useChatActions.ts)
The AI conversation engine (aiFlow.ts) manages the dialogue
Session and progress are persisted via the progress manager
Cultural styling is applied by styleUtils.ts
External AI services are accessed via aiService.ts
3. Key Subsystems
3.1 Context Management
The chat solution maintains context via:

ChatProvider: Provides state management for the chat interface
useChatSession: Manages persistent session IDs for conversation tracking
useChatProgress: Tracks and persists progress through registration flows
useChatMessages: Handles message history and updates
3.2 AI Integration
The system leverages AI via:

aiService.ts: Provides OpenAI API integration with retry logic
aiFlow.ts: Manages conversation flow using AI responses
generatePrompt.ts: Creates context-specific prompts for the AI
3.3 UI/UX Components
The user experience is delivered through:

ChatbotWidget: Main container that orchestrates all chat functionality
ChatMessagesList: Displays conversation history with scrolling behavior
MessageBubble: Styles individual messages with cultural adaptations
ChatOptionsRenderer: Renders multiple-choice options for structured interaction
3.4 Registration Flows
Registration is managed through:

chatRegistrationFlows.ts: Defines structured question flows by user role
useRoleSelection.ts: Handles user role identification and flow initiation
useChatProgress.ts: Tracks progression through registration sections
4. Key Features in Detail
4.1 Cultural Adaptation
The system incorporates Trinidad & Tobago cultural elements through:

Phrase Variations: The phrasings.ts file contains culturally appropriate expressions, greetings, and acknowledgments.
Styling Engine: The styleUtils.ts module applies transformations to messages with cultural expressions and dialect features.
MessageBubble Transformations: The MessageBubble.tsx component applies phrase replacements like "Alright" → "Cool cool" (though this is causing repetition issues).
4.2 Session Persistence
User sessions are maintained through:

Session ID: Generated and stored via useChatSession.ts
Progress Tracking: Managed by useChatProgress.ts and progressManager.ts
LocalStorage: Used to persist data between sessions
4.3 Role-Based Registration Flows
The system adapts to different user types:

Family: People seeking care services
Professional: Caregivers offering services
Community: Community supporters and volunteers
Each role has a customized registration flow defined in chatRegistrationFlows.ts with different sections and questions.

4.4 Dynamic Question Generation
Questions are generated through:

Message Generation: messageGenerationUtils.ts provides structured question formatting
AI-Enhanced Prompts: generatePrompt.ts creates natural, conversational questions
Variable Introduction: Random variation in question phrasing to sound more natural
4.5 Input Validation
The system validates user inputs via:

Field Type Detection: Identifies email, phone, name fields
Validation Rules: Applies appropriate validation logic
Error Messaging: Provides culturally styled error messages
5. Configuration Options
The system can be configured through:

Chat Mode: AI, scripted, or hybrid approaches
Temperature: Controls AI response creativity
Always Show Options: Forces display of options even for open-ended questions
Use AI Prompts: Toggles between scripted and AI-generated prompts
6. Current Issues and Gaps
6.1 "Cool cool" Repetition
Problem: The MessageBubble.tsx component has a hardcoded replacement that transforms "Alright" to "Cool cool" for every bot message, causing unnatural repetition.

Solution:

Remove or modify the repetitive phrase replacement in MessageBubble.tsx
Implement more subtle and varied transformations
Add rotation through different expressions
6.2 Inconsistent Format Guidance
Problem: Email and phone format examples are inconsistently shown.

Solution:

Standardize format guidance in messageGenerationUtils.ts
Enhance visual indication in the input field for specialized types
6.3 Session Persistence Issues
Problem: Chat sessions sometimes reset unexpectedly.

Solution:

Improve error handling in useChatSession.ts and useChatProgress.ts
Add more robust fallbacks for localStorage failures
Implement cross-tab synchronization
7. Technical Flow
7.1 Initialization Flow
ChatbotWidget mounts and initializes state
useChatSession generates or restores a session ID
useChatProgress loads any saved progress
initializeChat determines whether to start a new chat or resume
If resuming, handleResumeChat restores previous context
7.2 User Interaction Flow
User inputs text or selects an option
Input is processed by either handleSendMessage or handleOptionSelection
User's message is added to the chat
Field validation occurs if appropriate
Progress is updated and saved
AI response is generated via handleAIFlow
Response is styled with cultural adaptations
Typing is simulated with simulateBotTyping
Bot message is displayed with any options
7.3 Section Transition Flow
When currentSectionIndex changes, ChatMessagesList detects a section change
SectionTransition component displays the new section title
Transition message animation appears and fades after 3 seconds
New questions for the section begin
8. Edge Cases and Error Handling
8.1 Connection Failures
Retry mechanism in aiService.ts (up to 3 attempts)
Fallback error messages from phrasings.connectionErrors
Toast notifications to inform users
8.2 Input Validation Errors
Validation through validateChatInput with field-specific rules
Culturally appropriate error messages via stylizeValidationError
Visual feedback in the input field
8.3 LocalStorage Failures
Fallback to in-memory session in useChatSession
Error logging for debugging
Graceful degradation with continued functionality
9. Onboarding Experience
9.1 Current Implementation
The onboarding flow follows these steps:

Role Identification: Determining whether the user is family, professional, or community
Structured Sections: Guiding through role-specific registration sections
Adaptive Questions: Asking relevant questions based on previous answers
Progress Indication: Showing section transitions and completion status
Format Guidance: Providing examples for specialized fields (though inconsistently)
9.2 Evolution Path to Full Support Assistant
Phase 1: Enhanced Onboarding (Current Focus)
Fix identified issues (repetition, format guidance, session persistence)
Improve multi-selection handling
Add better progress visualization
Enhance personalization based on previous answers
Phase 2: Post-Registration Assistant
Implement status checking for registration
Provide account completion guidance
Add proactive suggestions based on profile status
Integrate FAQs and common user journeys
Phase 3: Full AI Concierge

Provide scheduling assistance
Offer payment processing guidance
Support community engagement features
Implement multi-modal interactions (text, voice, etc.)
10. Missing Pieces and Undocumented Logic
10.1 Server-Side Persistence
While there's code for syncing to Supabase in aiService.ts, the actual database schema and server-side implementation details are not fully documented.

10.2 Error Recovery
The system has basic error handling but lacks comprehensive retry and recovery strategies for all potential failure points.

10.3 Testing Framework
There's no documented approach for testing the chat system, including unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests.

10.4 Analytics and Monitoring
The system doesn't have a clear approach to tracking conversation metrics, completion rates, or identifying common failure points.
