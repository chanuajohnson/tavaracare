## 9. Analytics and Tracking

### Key Conversion Points to Track
- Visitor to registered user conversion
- Registration completion rate
- First care request submission
- First booking completion
- Repeat booking rate
- Caregiver retention after first service
- Payment method addition
- Feedback submission rate

### Drop-off Monitoring
- **Registration Abandonment Points:**
  - Identity verification step
  - Payment method addition
  - Profile completion

- **Care Request Abandonment Points:**
  - Schedule selection
  - Care details specification
  - Matching review
  - Confirmation step

- **Critical Path Monitoring:**
  - Time spent on each step
  - Return visits before completion
  - Error encounters during process
  - Support contact after abandonment

### A/B Testing Considerations
- **Testable Elements:**
  - Registration flow variations
  - Matching presentation formats
  - Pricing display options
  - Call-to-action wording and placement

- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Minimum sample size calculations
  - Equal distribution mechanisms
  - Consistent measurement periods
  - Isolated variables for clear causation

- **Implementation Guidelines:**
  - No concurrent tests in same user journey
  - Clear hypothesis and success metrics
  - Testing period appropriate to user volume
  - Segmentation capabilities for targeted testing

### User Success Metrics
- **Care Recipients:**
  - Time to first booking
  - Booking completion rate
  - Re-booking frequency
  - Average response time to matches
  - Cancellation rate
  - Platform engagement frequency

- **Caregivers:**
  - Profile completion thoroughness
  - Response rate to care requests
  - Booking acceptance rate
  - On-time arrival percentage
  - Service completion rate
  - Earnings per available hour

## 10. Accessibility Considerations

### Keyboard Navigation Paths
- Logical tab order following visual layout
- Focus indicators visible at all times
- Skip navigation links for efficient movement
- No keyboard traps in interactive elements
- Consistent keyboard shortcuts across platform

### Screen Reader Journey Adaptations
- ARIA landmarks for major sections
- Alternative text for all informational images
- Descriptive labels for all form controls
- Status announcements for dynamic changes
- Semantic HTML for inherent accessibility

### Time-Sensitive Interaction Accommodations
- Adjustable timeouts for authentication sessions
- Extended form submission windows
- Pause options for guided processes
- Warning before session expiration
- Simple resumption of interrupted processes

## Implementation Notes

This document serves as the foundation for user experience design and development across the TAVARA.CARE platform. All new features and modifications should conform to these documented flows or formally request amendments to this documentation.

The flows described represent the intended user journey and interaction patterns. Actual implementation may require technical adjustments while maintaining the core user experience principles outlined here.

Regular reviews of this documentation should be conducted alongside user research and feedback to ensure continued alignment with user needs and expectations.
