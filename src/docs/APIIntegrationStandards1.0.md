# TAVARA.CARE API Integration Standards 1.0

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose and Scope
This document defines the standards, best practices, and guidelines for designing, implementing, and maintaining APIs for the TAVARA.CARE platform. It establishes a consistent approach to API development that ensures security, scalability, and a seamless experience for all integrating parties. These standards apply to all internal APIs as well as those exposed to external partners and third-party integrations.

### API Philosophy and Design Principles
TAVARA.CARE APIs are built on the following core principles:

1. **Resource-Oriented**: APIs are structured around resources rather than actions, following REST principles.
2. **Predictable**: APIs behave in consistent, expected ways across all endpoints.
3. **Secure by Design**: Security is integrated from the beginning, not added as an afterthought.
4. **Developer-Friendly**: Well-documented, intuitive, and easy to use for developers.
5. **Performance-Focused**: Optimized for speed, efficiency, and minimal data transfer.
6. **Versioned**: APIs evolve in a controlled manner that doesn't break existing implementations.
7. **Self-Descriptive**: APIs provide clear feedback and discoverable functionality.

### Glossary of Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Resource | A specific object or entity type within the system (e.g., User, Caregiver, Care Request) |
| Endpoint | A specific URL path that represents a resource or collection of resources |
| HTTP Method | The action to be performed on a resource (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) |
| Response Code | Standard HTTP status codes indicating the result of a request |
| Authentication | The process of verifying the identity of a client making API requests |
| Authorization | The process of determining if an authenticated client has permission to access a resource |
| Rate Limiting | Restrictions on the number of API requests a client can make in a given time period |
| Payload | The data sent in the body of an API request or response |
| JWT | JSON Web Token, a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims securely between two parties |
| Idempotency | The property where multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request |

## 2. API Architecture Overview

### REST API Design Principles
All TAVARA.CARE APIs follow REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural principles:

1. **Stateless Communication**: Each request contains all information needed to complete it.
2. **Client-Server Separation**: Clear separation of concerns between client and server.
3. **Cacheable Responses**: Responses explicitly define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable.
4. **Uniform Interface**: Consistent, standardized methods of interaction with resources.
5. **Layered System**: Client cannot tell whether it is connected directly to the end server or an intermediary.
6. **Resource Identification**: Resources are identified in requests using URIs.

### Resource Naming Conventions

1. **Use Nouns for Resources**: Resources should be named using plural nouns representing the entity.
   - Good: `/caregivers`, `/care-requests`
   - Avoid: `/getCaregivers`, `/manage-request`

2. **Use Kebab Case**: Use lowercase letters with hyphens for multi-word resource names.
   - Good: `/care-requests`, `/service-types`
   - Avoid: `/careRequests`, `/ServiceTypes`

3. **Hierarchical Relationships**: Express resource relationships through nested paths.
   - Good: `/caregivers/{id}/qualifications`, `/care-recipients/{id}/care-requests`
   - Avoid: `/getQualificationsForCaregiver/{id}`

4. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent naming patterns across all resources.

### Endpoint Structure and Patterns

| HTTP Method | Endpoint Pattern | Purpose | Example |
|-------------|------------------|---------|---------|
| GET | /resources | List collection | GET /caregivers |
| GET | /resources/{id} | Retrieve specific resource | GET /caregivers/123 |
| POST | /resources | Create new resource | POST /care-requests |
| PUT | /resources/{id} | Replace resource completely | PUT /caregivers/123 |
| PATCH | /resources/{id} | Update resource partially | PATCH /care-requests/456 |
| DELETE | /resources/{id} | Delete resource | DELETE /caregivers/123 |

**Special Endpoint Patterns:**

1. **Resource Actions**: For operations that don't fit the standard CRUD model, use resource-action pattern:
   - `POST /resources/{id}/actions/{action-name}`
   - Example: `POST /care-requests/123/actions/cancel`

2. **Search Endpoints**: For complex search operations beyond filtering:
   - `GET /resources/search`
   - Example: `GET /caregivers/search?skills=medical&available=true`

3. **Batch Operations**: For operations on multiple resources:
   - `POST /resources/batch`
   - Example: `POST /notifications/batch`

### Versioning Strategy

TAVARA.CARE APIs use URI path versioning to ensure backward compatibility:

1. **Major Version in Path**: `/api/v1/resource`
2. **Version Lifecycle**:
   - **Development**: Initial development version (not for production)
   - **Beta**: Production-ready but subject to changes
   - **Stable**: Production-ready and changes follow deprecation policy
   - **Deprecated**: Still functional but scheduled for removal
   - **Sunset**: No longer available

3. **Version Transition Rules**:
   - Major versions (v1, v2) for breaking changes
   - Support at least one previous major version for 12 months after new version release
   - Provide migration guides between major versions
   - Communicate deprecation schedules at least 6 months in advance

### Environment Separation

| Environment | Purpose | URL Pattern | Access Control |
|-------------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Development | Internal development and testing | `api-dev.tavara.care` | Developer accounts only |
| Staging | Pre-production testing | `api-staging.tavara.care` | Restricted partner access |
| Production | Live system | `api.tavara.care` | Full access with rate limits |

**Environment Rules**:
1. Production and non-production environments must be physically separate
2. Data must never flow from development to production
3. Sanitized data may flow from production to development with PII removed
4. Each environment must have its own authentication system
5. Test accounts must be clearly marked and never usable in production

## 3. Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Methods

TAVARA.CARE supports the following authentication methods:

1. **OAuth 2.0** (Primary Method)
   - Authorization Code flow for web applications
   - PKCE extension for mobile and single-page applications
   - Client Credentials flow for server-to-server communication
   - Authorization server: `auth.tavara.care`

2. **API Keys** (Limited Usage)
   - For specific partner integrations only
   - Less secure than OAuth 2.0, used only when necessary
   - Transmitted via HTTP header: `X-API-Key`

3. **JWT Tokens**
   - Issued after successful OAuth authentication
   - Short-lived access tokens (1 hour)
   - Refresh tokens for obtaining new access tokens (14 days)
   - Transmitted via HTTP header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### Token Management and Refresh Procedures

1. **Access Token Lifecycle**:
   - Obtain via OAuth flow or refresh token
   - Valid for 60 minutes
   - Include in all authenticated requests in Authorization header

2. **Refresh Token Usage**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /oauth/token`
   - Parameters: `grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={token}`
   - Returns new access token and refresh token
   - Maximum refresh period: 14 days, then re-authentication required

3. **Token Revocation**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /oauth/revoke`
   - Immediate invalidation of tokens
   - Required during sign-out and suspected security breach

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

TAVARA.CARE uses the following roles for API access control:

1. **User Roles**:
   - `care_recipient`: Individual or family seeking care
   - `caregiver`: Professional providing care services
   - `agency_admin`: Administrator for care agency
   - `platform_admin`: TAVARA.CARE platform administrator

2. **System Roles**:
   - `service_account`: Non-human system integration
   - `analytics`: Read-only access for reporting systems
   - `billing`: Access to payment and invoice operations

3. **Role Assignment and Verification**:
   - Roles stored in JWT tokens as claims
   - Multiple roles per user supported
   - Role verification performed on every protected request

### Permission Levels and Scopes

OAuth 2.0 scopes define the specific permissions granted to applications:

1. **Core Scopes**:
   - `profile`: Basic user profile information
   - `profile:read`: Read-only access to profile
   - `profile:write`: Ability to update profile
   - `care:read`: View care requests and bookings
   - `care:write`: Create and modify care requests
   - `calendar:read`: View availability and schedule
   - `calendar:write`: Modify availability and schedule
   - `messaging:read`: Read conversation history
   - `messaging:write`: Send and receive messages

2. **Administrative Scopes**:
   - `admin:users`: User management capabilities
   - `admin:content`: Content management
   - `admin:billing`: Billing system access
   - `admin:reports`: Reporting and analytics

3. **Scope Best Practices**:
   - Request only scopes necessary for functionality
   - Users must explicitly consent to scope requests
   - Scopes can be revoked individually
   - Requested scopes must be documented in API registration

### Security Best Practices

1. **TLS Encryption**:
   - All API endpoints require TLS 1.2 or higher
   - HTTP requests automatically redirected to HTTPS
   - HSTS headers implemented

2. **Token Security**:
   - Never transmit tokens in URL parameters
   - Store tokens securely (secure HTTP-only cookies or secure storage)
   - Validate token signature and expiration on every request
   - Implement automatic token rotation for suspected breaches

3. **Request Protection**:
   - Implement CSRF protection for browser-based applications
   - Validate Content-Type headers
   - Set appropriate CORS headers for browser access

4. **Sensitive Data Handling**:
   - Never expose passwords or security credentials in responses
   - Mask sensitive data in logging systems
   - Use data minimization principles in responses

### Rate Limiting and Throttling Policies

1. **Default Rate Limits**:
   - Standard tier: 60 requests per minute
   - Partner tier: 300 requests per minute
   - Enterprise tier: 1200 requests per minute

2. **Specialized Endpoints**:
   - Search operations: 30 requests per minute
   - Batch operations: 10 requests per minute
   - Authentication: 10 requests per minute

3. **Rate Limit Headers**:
   - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Total requests allowed in period
   - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in period
   - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when limit resets (Unix timestamp)

4. **Exceeding Rate Limits**:
   - Returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
   - Includes `Retry-After` header with seconds to wait

## 4. Data Structures and Formats

### JSON Schema Standards

All API requests and responses use JSON as the primary data format:

1. **Schema Definition**:
   - All models defined using JSON Schema specification
   - Schemas published at `/api/v1/schemas/{model-name}`
   - Schema validation performed on all incoming requests

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Property names in camelCase: `firstName`, `careRequestId`
   - Boolean properties with "is" or "has" prefix: `isActive`, `hasCompletedTraining`
   - Consistent pluralization for array properties: `skills`, `certifications`

3. **Property Types**:
   - Use specific types where possible (string, number, boolean)
   - Document format expectations for strings (email, date, etc.)
   - Avoid mixed types for the same property

### Common Data Models

Core data models used throughout the API:

1. **User**:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "string",
     "email": "string",
     "firstName": "string",
     "lastName": "string",
     "phoneNumber": "string",
     "profilePictureUrl": "string",
     "userType": "care_recipient|caregiver|agency_admin|platform_admin",
     "createdAt": "string (ISO 8601)",
     "updatedAt": "string (ISO 8601)"
   }
   ```

2. **CareRequest**:

       }
     ],
     "availability": [
       {
         "dayOfWeek": "monday|tuesday|wednesday|thursday|friday|saturday|sunday",
         "startTime": "string (HH:MM)",
         "endTime": "string (HH:MM)"
       }
     ],
     "hourlyRate": "number",
     "travelRadius": "number (miles)",
     "averageRating": "number",
     "reviewCount": "number",
     "createdAt": "string (ISO 8601)",
     "updatedAt": "string (ISO 8601)"
   }
   ```

### Date and Time Format Standards

1. **Date and Time Representation**:
   - ISO 8601 format for all timestamps: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
   - Always use UTC for API communication
   - Include timezone information when relevant
   - Example: `2023-04-15T14:30:00Z`

2. **Duration Representation**:
   - ISO 8601 duration format: `PnYnMnDTnHnMnS`
   - Example: `PT2H30M` (2 hours and 30 minutes)
   - Consistent units for specific properties (hours for care duration, etc.)

3. **Date-Only Fields**:
   - ISO 8601 date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Example: `2023-04-15`

### Enumeration Values and Formats

1. **Enumeration Representation**:
   - Use strings for enum values
   - Use snake_case for enum values: `personal_care`, `in_progress`
   - Document all possible values in API documentation
   - Return 400 Bad Request for invalid enum values

2. **Common Enumerations**:
   - User Types: `care_recipient`, `caregiver`, `agency_admin`, `platform_admin`
   - Care Types: `personal_care`, `companionship`, `specialized`, `medical`, `transportation`
   - Booking Status: `draft`, `submitted`, `matching`, `matched`, `confirmed`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `disputed`

### Localization Considerations

1. **Language Support**:
   - Accept `Accept-Language` header for language preference
   - Return `Content-Language` header with the language used
   - Default to English (en-US) if not specified
   - Document all supported languages

2. **Localized Content**:
   - Localized fields use suffix pattern: `description_en`, `description_es`
   - Alternatively, use object structure: `{"en": "English text", "es": "Spanish text"}`
   - Currency values include currency code: `{"amount": 25.00, "currency": "USD"}`

3. **Regional Formatting**:
   - API always uses standardized formats regardless of locale
   - Formatting for display is handled client-side
   - Regional defaults (like date format) are never assumed

### File Upload Specifications

1. **Upload Methods**:
   - Direct upload: `POST /files` with `multipart/form-data`
   - Presigned URL: Get URL from `POST /files/presigned` then upload directly

2. **File Limitations**:
   - Maximum file size: 10MB (standard), 50MB (documents), 100MB (media)
   - Supported formats documented per endpoint
   - Malware scanning performed on all uploads
   - Automatic rejection of potentially dangerous file types

3. **File Metadata**:
   - Filename sanitization performed automatically
   - Content-Type verification and enforcement
   - Automatic generation of secure URL for access
   - Optional metadata fields: description, tags, related entity IDs

## 5. Request and Response Standards

### HTTP Methods and Their Usage

| Method | Purpose | Idempotent | Safe | Cacheable |
|--------|---------|------------|------|-----------|
| GET | Retrieve resource(s) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| POST | Create new resource or submit data | No | No | No |
| PUT | Replace resource completely | Yes | No | No |
| PATCH | Update resource partially | No* | No | No |
| DELETE | Remove resource | Yes | No | No |
| OPTIONS | Get supported methods | Yes | Yes | No |
| HEAD | Get headers only (like GET without body) | Yes | Yes | Yes |

*PATCH can be made idempotent with careful implementation

**Usage Guidelines**:
- GET for reading data only, no side effects
- POST for creating resources or operations with side effects
- PUT for complete replacement of a resource
- PATCH for partial updates (using JSON Patch or JSON Merge Patch)
- DELETE for resource removal

### HTTP Status Codes and When to Use Each

| Code Range | Category | Common Examples |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| 2xx | Success | 200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content |
| 3xx | Redirection | 301 Moved Permanently, 304 Not Modified |
| 4xx | Client Error | 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found |
| 5xx | Server Error | 500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable |

**Specific Status Codes**:

| Code | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| 200 OK | Successful request with response body |
| 201 Created | Resource successfully created |
| 204 No Content | Successful request with no response body |
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid request format or parameters |
| 401 Unauthorized | Missing or invalid authentication |
| 403 Forbidden | Authentication valid but insufficient permissions |
| 404 Not Found | Resource doesn't exist |
| 409 Conflict | Request conflicts with current state (e.g., duplicate) |
| 422 Unprocessable Entity | Request format valid but semantically incorrect |
| 429 Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Unexpected server error |
| 503 Service Unavailable | Service temporarily unavailable |

### Request Headers Requirements

| Header | Purpose | Required |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Authorization | Authentication credentials | Yes (for authenticated endpoints) |
| Content-Type | Format of request body | Yes (when body present) |
| Accept | Requested response format | No (defaults to application/json) |
| Accept-Language | Preferred response language | No (defaults to en-US) |
| User-Agent | Client identification | Yes |
| X-Request-ID | Client-generated request identifier | Recommended |
| X-API-Version | Specific API version request | No (defaults to latest) |
| Idempotency-Key | Unique key for idempotent requests | Yes (for POST/PATCH) |

### Response Structure and Formatting

All API responses follow a consistent structure:

1. **Success Response Structure**:
   ```json
   {
     "data": {
       // Resource data or operation result
     },
     "meta": {
       "timestamp": "2023-04-15T14:30:00Z",
       "requestId": "req_abc123",
       "pagination": {
         "totalCount": 100,
         "pageSize": 10,
         "currentPage": 1,
         "totalPages": 10
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Error Response Structure**:
   ```json
   {
     "error": {
       "code": "invalid_parameter",
       "message": "The request contains invalid parameters",
       "details": [
         {
           "field": "email",
           "issue": "format",
           "description": "Must be a valid email address"
         }
       ]
     },
     "meta": {
       "timestamp": "2023-04-15T14:30:00Z",
       "requestId": "req_abc123"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Response Headers**:
   | Header | Purpose |
   |--------|---------|
   | Content-Type | Format of response (always application/json) |
   | X-Request-ID | Echo of client request ID or generated ID |
   | X-API-Version | Version of API that processed the request |
   | Cache-Control | Caching directives for the response |

### Pagination Implementation

1. **Request Parameters**:
   - `page`: Page number (1-based)
   - `size`: Items per page (default 20, max 100)
   - `sort`: Field to sort by (e.g., `createdAt`)
   - `direction`: Sort direction (`asc` or `desc`)

2. **Response Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "data": [
       // Array of resource objects
     ],
     "meta": {
       "pagination": {
         "totalCount": 100,
         "pageSize": 10,
         "currentPage": 1,
         "totalPages": 10
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Link Header** (Alternative Approach):
   - Include RFC 5988 Link header with navigation URLs
   - Example: `Link: <https://api.tavara.care/caregivers?page=2&size=10>; rel="next", <https://api.tavara.care/caregivers?page=10&size=10>; rel="last"`

### Filtering, Sorting, and Searching Parameters

1. **Filtering**:
   - Simple filters: `?status=active&careType=personal_care`
   - Range filters: `?createdAt[gte]=2023-01-01&createdAt[lte]=2023-01-31`
   - Multiple values: `?status=active,pending`
   - Boolean filters: `?isVerified=true`

2. **Sorting**:
   - Single field: `?sort=createdAt&direction=desc`
   - Multiple fields: `?sort=lastName,firstName&direction=asc`
   - Default sorting documented per endpoint

3. **Searching**:
   - Simple search: `?search=keyword`
   - Field-specific search: `?search[name]=John&search[city]=Boston`
   - Advanced search available via dedicated endpoints

### Partial Response with Field Selection

1. **Fields Parameter**:
   - Select specific fields: `?fields=id,firstName,lastName`
   - Nested field selection: `?fields=id,address[city,state]`
   - Default returns all fields unless specified

2. **Implementation Rules**:
   - Required fields always returned regardless of selection
   - Unknown fields in selection ignored
   - Performance optimization for large resources
   - Documentation indicates which fields are selectable

## 6. Error Handling

### Error Response Format

All error responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code_string",
    "message": "Human readable message",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "specific_field",
        "issue": "issue_type",
        "description": "Detailed explanation"
      }
    ]
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2023-04-15T14:30:00Z",
    "requestId": "req_abc123"
  }
}
```

1. **Error Components**:
   - `code`: Machine-readable error code string
   - `message`: Human-readable description for developers
   - `details`: Array of specific issues (for validation errors)
   - `meta`: Standard metadata including timestamp and request ID

2. **Localization**:
   - Error messages should not be displayed directly to end users
   - Error codes should be used for client-side localization
   - Language-specific messages not provided in API responses

### Error Codes and Messaging Standards

1. **Error Code Format**:
   - Snake_case string: `invalid_parameter`, `resource_not_found`
   - Prefix for category: `auth_`, `validation_`, `resource_`
   - Specific and unambiguous

2. **Common Error Codes**:

| Error Code | Description | HTTP Status |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `authentication_required` | No authentication provided | 401 |
| `invalid_credentials` | Invalid or expired credentials | 401 |
| `insufficient_permissions` | Authenticated but unauthorized | 403 |
| `resource_not_found` | Requested resource does not exist | 404 |
| `validation_failed` | Request data failed validation | 400 |
| `invalid_parameter` | One or more parameters invalid | 400 |
| `duplicate_resource` | Resource already exists | 409 |
| `rate_limit_exceeded` | Too many requests | 429 |
| `server_error` | Unexpected server error | 500 |
| `service_unavailable` | Service temporarily down | 503 |

3. **Message Guidelines**:
   - Clear and concise
   - Action-oriented when possible
   - No sensitive data in messages
   - Consistent terminology
   - No blame language (avoid "you" statements)

### Validation Error Handling

1. **Validation Error Structure**:
   ```json
   {
     "error": {
       "code": "validation_failed",
       "message": "The request contains invalid or missing data",
       "details": [
         {
           "field": "email",
           "issue": "format",
           "description": "Must be a valid email address"
         },
         {
           "field": "phoneNumber",
           "issue": "required",
           "description": "Phone number is required"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Common Validation Issues**:
   - `required`: Field is missing but required
   - `format`: Field format is invalid
   - `min`/`max`: Value outside allowed range
   - `enum`: Value not in allowed set
   - `type`: Incorrect data type
   - `unique`: Value conflicts with existing resource

3. **Field References**:
   - Simple fields: `firstName`
   - Nested fields: `address.zipCode`
   - Array items: `certifications[0].name`

### Business Logic Error Handling

1. **Business Rule Violations**:
   - HTTP Status: Usually 422 Unprocessable Entity
   - Clear error code indicating business rule
   - Explanation of why the operation cannot be completed

2. **Example Business Logic Errors**:

| Error Code | Description | HTTP Status |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `booking_schedule_conflict` | Requested time conflicts with existing booking | 422 |
| `insufficient_qualifications` | Caregiver lacks required qualifications | 422 |
| `recipient_payment_required` | Payment method required before booking | 422 |

3. **Resolution Guidance**:
   - When possible, include suggestion for resolving the issue
   - Reference relevant policy documentation
   - Provide support contact for complex issues

### System and Service Errors

1. **Internal Server Errors**:
   - Minimally detailed public response (avoid exposing internals)
   - Comprehensive internal logging with full error details
   - Unique error reference for support inquiries
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "error": {
         "code": "server_error",
         "message": "An unexpected error occurred",
         "reference": "err_abc123"
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Service Availability Errors**:
   - Clear indication of temporary nature
   - Retry-After header when applicable
   - Status page reference when available
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "error": {
         "code": "service_unavailable",
         "message": "Service temporarily unavailable",
         "retryAfter": 300
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Dependency Failures**:
   - Generic description without exposing dependency details
   - Internal alerting for failed dependencies
   - Circuit breaking for persistent failures

### Retry Strategies and Idempotency

1. **Idempotent Endpoints**:
   - All GET, PUT, and DELETE requests naturally idempotent
   - POST and PATCH made idempotent with Idempotency-Key header

2. **Idempotency Implementation**:
   - Client generates unique Idempotency-Key (UUID recommended)
   - Server stores request result keyed by Idempotency-Key
   - Duplicate requests return stored result instead of re-processing
   - Keys expire after 24 hours

3. **Retry Recommendations**:
   - Exponential backoff with jitter
   - Initial retry after 1 second
   - Maximum of 5 retries for most operations
   - Only retry for 5xx errors and 429 (rate limit)
   - Never retry for 4xx errors (except 429)

## 7. Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategies and Headers

1. **Cache Control Headers**:
   - `Cache-Control: no-cache` - For frequently changing or user-specific data
   - `Cache-Control: max-age=300` - For semi-static data (5 min)
   - `Cache-Control: max-age=3600` - For static reference data (1 hour)
   - `ETag` - For validation caching

2. **Cacheable Resources**:
   - Reference data (service types, qualification types, etc.)
   - Public profiles and static information
   - Search results (short duration)
   - Aggregated statistics and reports

3. **Non-Cacheable Resources**:
   - User-specific data (current user's profile, bookings)
   - Real-time availability information
   - Financial transactions
   - Authentication and authorization endpoints

### Compression Methods

1. **Response Compression**:
   - gzip compression for all text responses
   - Client indicates support via Accept-Encoding header
   - Server responds with Content-Encoding header
   - Images and files use appropriate format-specific compression

2. **Implementation Guidelines**:
   - Don't compress responses smaller than 1KB
   - Don't compress already compressed formats (JPEG, PNG, PDF)
   - Use compression level balancing CPU usage and size reduction
   - Monitor compression ratio and performance impact

### Request Timeout Policies

1. **Request Timeout Configuration**:
   - Standard endpoints: 30-second maximum processing time
   - Long-running operations: 60-second maximum before moving to background
   - Background processing for operations expected to exceed limits

2. **Timeout Communication**:
   - HTTP 503 response for service timeouts
   - Retry-After header indicating when to retry
   - Background job ID for checking status of long operations

3. **Client-Side Recommendations**:
   - Set appropriate request timeouts (slightly longer than server timeouts)
   - Implement graceful timeout handling
   - Follow retry recommendations with backoff

### Batch Operations

1. **Batch Request Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "operations": [
       {
         "method": "GET",
         "path": "/caregivers/123",
         "reference": "op1"
       },
       {
         "method": "POST",
         "path": "/messages",
         "body": {
           "recipientId": "user_456",
           "content": "Hello"
         },
         "reference": "op2"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Batch Response Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "results": [
       {
         "reference": "op1",
         "status": 200,
         "body": {
           // Caregiver data
         }
       },
       {
         "reference": "op2",
         "status": 201,
         "body": {
           // Message data
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Batch Operation Rules**:
   - Maximum 20 operations per batch request
   - Operations processed in order unless specified otherwise
   - Independent success/failure for each operation
   - Atomic transactions not guaranteed across operations
   - All operations executed with same authentication context

### Asynchronous Processing Patterns

1. **When to Use Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Operations exceeding 30-second processing time
   - Resource-intensive operations
   - Operations dependent on external systems
   - Bulk data processing

2. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Initial request returns 202 Accepted with job ID
   - Provides status endpoint URL in response
   - Client polls status endpoint for completion
   - Webhooks for completion notification when available

3. **Status Endpoint Response**:
   ```json
   {
     "data": {
       "jobId": "job_abc123",
       "status": "in_progress|completed|failed",
       "progress": 45,
       "estimatedCompletion": "2023-04-15T14:45:00Z",
       "result": {
         // Present only when completed
       },
       "error": {
         // Present only when failed
       }
     }
   }
   ```

     }
   }
   ```

3. **Event Versioning**:
   - Event schema versioning with `apiVersion` field
   - Maintains backward compatibility within major versions
   - Version included in event type for breaking changes

### Delivery Guarantees and Retry Logic

1. **Delivery Policy**:
   - At-least-once delivery guarantee
   - Events delivered in approximate chronological order
   - Duplicate events possible (clients must handle idempotently)

2. **Retry Schedule**:
   - Initial attempt immediate
   - Retries at increasing intervals: 5s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, 10m, 30m, 1h, 2h, 5h
   - Maximum retry period: 24 hours
   - Failed delivery logged after maximum retries

3. **Successful Delivery**:
   - HTTP 2xx response required to confirm receipt
   - Response timeout: 30 seconds
   - Any other response or timeout triggers retry

### Webhook Security

   - HMAC signature in `X-Tavara-Signature` header
   - Shared secret established during webhook setup
   - Payload signed with HMAC-SHA256 algorithm

2. **Verification Process**:
   - Compute HMAC signature of raw request body
   - Compare to signature in header using constant-time comparison
   - Reject requests with missing or invalid signatures
   - Timestamp included to prevent replay attacks

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Rotate webhook secrets periodically
   - Use HTTPS endpoints only
   - Validate event types before processing
   - Implement request timeout for webhook processing

### Subscription Management

1. **Webhook Registration**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /webhooks`
   - Required parameters: `url`, `event_types`, `description`
   - Returns webhook ID and secret for verification

2. **Subscription Updates**:
   - Update endpoint URL: `PATCH /webhooks/{id}`
   - Modify subscribed events: `PUT /webhooks/{id}/events`
   - Disable/enable webhook: `PATCH /webhooks/{id}/status`

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test endpoint: `POST /webhooks/{id}/test`
   - Sends sample event of each subscribed type
   - Webhook logs accessible for debugging
   - Health metrics for delivery success rate
